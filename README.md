## About Me
Final-year Software Engineering student (Belgium Campus, ZA) focused on building reliable backends and algorithmic solutions. 
I enjoy turning hard problems into clean, scalable code, especially in optimization (LP/IP, Simplex, Branch & Bound). 
Currently polishing **LinearPro_** and a few portfolio apps (API backends, Mongo/Postgres data layers, and a VR drone HUD).
